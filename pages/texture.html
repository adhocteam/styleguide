    <p>When we are looking for texture in a design, our go-to is the Penrose Tile. Itâ€™s a non-repeating tiling pattern. Our sample is, of course, finite.</p>
    <p>It shows up in both green and grey hues. Depending on the medium (letterpress) we sometimes alter the number of colors involved.</p>

      <h2>Primary treatment</h2>
      <p>Frequently used in a header or behind the logo on a business card.</p>

      <h2>Secondary treatment</h2>
      <p>Used in the footer or some other swath of space.</p>

# Using a Yubikey at Ad Hoc

## Why:
- Easier to Use
- More Secure
- Free!
- And [More!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dPAtLbnyoeN-_pMVEsN5uWZrPvgkdAB8lJwN7jx1Wsc/edit?usp=sharing)

## What to Do
### 1. Get your Ad Hoc Yubikey
- Contact Jenn Matchus (@jenn, jenn@adhocteam.us)
Most employees got a Yubikey in their onboarding swag shipment. Earlier employees may have received one at a Retreat.
If you never received one (or lost it), Jenn has them in inventory. If you need to swap connector types (USB-A for
USB-C or vice versa), Jenn can help with that.

### 2. Setup Google
- Google provides [instructions that will work for adhocteam.us accounts](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523).
Google is the most important account to secure and the one we will be tracking in All Hands.
[GitHub supports Yubikeys](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication/#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-fido-u2f) for securing your account there, which is encouraged!
Yubikey provides [a longer list of services it supports.](https://www.yubico.com/setup/#security-key) You are welcome and encouraged to use your Yubikey to secure personal accounts as well corporate ones!

### 3. Tap the button
- During your login, you should be prompted to tap the glowing button after entering your password. That's it!
